# HorsingAround
Quick and dirty minigame

## Description
This project serves the purpose of refreshing Unity and OOP development for myself after a short break.
Code and solutions here are not intended to be clean, elegant or overall production ready, just quick prototyping to get me back on the saddle.

I had my 4- year old for a theme for a game and as my client he asked for a horse game where you could jump over pittfalls, eat grass, flowers and toast.
